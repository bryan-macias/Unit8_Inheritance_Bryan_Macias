#######Pseudocode for how the program was written. (Main Idea)######
First create a class that will hold all of the cost variables
books, food, travel, etc.

Another class, semester that will be derived from cost so it can use the member functions and in this class there will be more detailed functions for handling certain calculations such as tuition, booksCost, foodCost etc.

Another function to display the interface and menu
  (mimic the excel used as a reference)

Another function of the selection menu
  (using the basis of my scoreboard GUI)
  Ex.
    A. Cost Per credit class
    B. Hours Per Class
    C. Hours in a semester.
  
Another function to handle the selection and edit the selected option
  (using setters and getters to update information and thus update the whole program)
  Using if else if blocks to handle the commands.

In the main()
  instantiate three different classes, each in respect to the type of semester. IE full, part, or half time

  then using a do{}while loop, to help loop the program and update information
